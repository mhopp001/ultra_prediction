# Ultra Marathon Completion Prediction

Predicting whether a runner completes a 50-mile ultra marathon based on their weekly training mileage using linear and logistic regression.

## Project Overview
This project explores how training volume (measured in miles per week) affects the likelihood of completing a 50-mile ultra marathon. Using both **linear regression** (for exploration) and **logistic regression** (for probability-based predictions), the project demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to binary classification in sports analytics.

### Data
- `df.csv` — Training dataset with runners’ weekly mileage and completion status (`completed_50m_ultra`: 0 = Did Not Finish, 1 = Finished).  
- `df2.csv` — Dataset for prediction on new runners.
